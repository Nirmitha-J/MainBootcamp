ans:
1. You type maps.google.com into the address bar of your browser.
2. The browser checks the cache for a DNS record to find the corresponding IP address of maps.google.com.

4. The browser initiates a TCP connection with the server.

6. The server handles the request and sends back a response.
7. The server sends out an HTTP response
8. The browser displays the HTML content (for HTML responses, which is the most common).
