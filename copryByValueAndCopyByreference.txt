4)  Write a write up on Difference between copy by value and copy by reference. ?

Ans: Data Types in JavaScript
Data types basically specify what kind of data can be stored and manipulated within a program.
There are six basic data types in JavaScript which can be divided into three main categories:
-primitive (or primary), composite (or reference), and special data types. 
-String, Number, and Boolean are primitive data types. 
-Object, Array, and Function (which are all types of objects) are composite data types. 
-Whereas Undefined and Null are special data types.

Copy By Value
-In Copy by value the data which variable hold is passed to another variable . 
-Both the variables refers two different memory locations.

example:
var a = 20;
var copied_by_value = a;
console.log(a, copied_by_value); // 20,20
copied_by_value = 100;
console.log(a, copied_by_value); // 20,100

In the above example For variable named copied_by_value data which is present in the a is copied not value .
Even if contents of Copied variable are changed original variable value from which it is copied remain same .


Copy by reference
-For composite data types objects are copied by reference. 
-Actual variable and copied variable both refer to same memory location . 
-SO change in data of copied variable will lead to change in data of original variable too.

var a = [1,2,3];
var b = a;
console.log(a,b); // [1,2,3] [1,2,3]
var b[1]=20;
console.log(a,b); // [1,20,3] [1,20,3]

In the above example we could notice that changing the value of copied variable lead to change of original variable from which it is copied as they both refer same memory location.
